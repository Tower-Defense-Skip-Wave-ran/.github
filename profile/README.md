## Overview

The **Tower Defense Skip Wave Script** is built to manipulate wave flow in The Tower, an idle tower defense game where wave pacing is crucial. With this script, players can skip incoming waves instantly, sometimes even triggering **multiple wave skips in a row**. But it’s not just a time-saver—it’s a mastery tool for players who want to scale fast and tactically. 💡

Keep in mind, this script is designed exclusively for **Windows PC only**. No cross-platform tricks here—pure desktop domination.

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

**🔥 Waves Skipped in Sequence:**  
Skip multiple waves back-to-back. Stack your skips and blast through dozens at once.

**⚔️ Free Upgrades:**  
When skips stack, so do the upgrades. For every wave you skip, this can trigger free upgrades equal to the number skipped—talk about cheat code energy.

**💰 Income vs Wave Balance:**  
Skips come with trade-offs—less income per wave, but faster enemy scaling. Use wisely and strategize like a boss.

**📈 Wave-Based and Income-Based Triggers:**  
Two core interaction types—some skips are based on the wave number, others on your in-game income bracket. Master both to maximize your efficiency.

**🌀 Loop-Triggered Skipping:**  
The script can activate wave skips even if a wave ends before the typical 10-second cycle. Speedrun mode, anyone?

**🧠 Complex Interactions:**  
The Wave Skip card isn’t just a click-and-go—it plays with several in-game systems. Use it to influence tower progression, enemy difficulty, and upgrade timing.

**🎯 Press-to-Skip Mechanic:**  
In co-op games, all players must manually hit skip. This script automates or accelerates that logic for solo dominance.

**⚡ Ultra Rare Skip Chains:**  
There’s a lottery element too—every few thousand waves, you might roll a 5x skip chain. Theoretically, a 10x skip is possible in ultra-endgame scenarios!

## Community Feedback / Safety Tips 🛡️

> “If you skip a wave, you get less money and the enemies get better faster… so it’s not that efficient unless they don’t improve for the skipped wave.” – *r/TheTowerGame*

💡 **Pro Tip:** Combine wave skips with tower buffs or income cards to offset the lowered cash flow. Timing is everything—don’t just skip blind!
